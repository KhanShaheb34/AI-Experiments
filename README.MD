# Artificial Intelligence Experiments

Doing some experiments on the algorithms I studied on Artificial Intelligence course in Software Engineering.

## Algorithms

- [A\* Search Algorithm](https://ai-experiments.vercel.app/algorithms/astar-search.html)
- [Greedy Search Algorithm](https://ai-experiments.vercel.app/algorithms/greedy-search.html)
- [Breadth-First Search Algorithm](https://ai-experiments.vercel.app/algorithms/bfs.html)
- [Depth-First Search Algorithm](https://ai-experiments.vercel.app/algorithms/dfs.html)
- [Uniform Cost Search Algorithm](https://ai-experiments.vercel.app/algorithms/ucs.html)

## How to run

Installed necessary packages:

```sh
yarn or npm
```

To run the development build:

```sh
yarn dev or npm run dev
```

To run the production build:

```sh
yarn build or npm run build
```

To preview the production build:

```sh
yarn preview or npm run preview
```
